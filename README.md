## setup and build
### prerequisites
- install java
- install node
- install docker

### build and run the app
Use this when:
- you want to run the app for the first time
- you want to run the app with changed code

`./gradlew buildAndRunDocker`

### run the app
`./gradlew runDocker`

### stop the app
`./gradlew removeDocker`

### Quick UI development
To be able to quickly test changes to the UI code without the bother of restarting the whole thing:
- open a terminal and navigate to `front-end/`
- execute `npm run start`
- navigate to http://localhost:4200/

**Note:** the frontend build uses test data from the following file: `front-end/src/assets/example-calendars/example.json`   
To easily update this test data file, simply use the gradle/docker way to set up the app, use your browser to navigate to the app with the network tab open, click on the backend call and use the response json to overwrite the data in `example.json`.

## Configure custom days
To overwrite days generated by the default cycle, add them to the json file located here: `src/main/resources/custom-days.json`

The currently supported overwritable fields are:

| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| date | The date you want to overwrite |
| top | Overwrite the text of the top slot of a day |
| bottom | Overwrite the text of the bottom slot of a day |
| prd | Overwrite the production version of a day |

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2020/12/30",
    "top": "Tonight: prd install 10.118!",
    "bottom": "",
    "prd": ""
  },
  {
    "date": "2020/12/31",
    "top": "",
    "bottom": "Prd install moved to day before",
    "prd": "10.118"
  }
]
```

## Heroku

    - `heroku login`
    - `heroku container:login`
    - `heroku container:push web -a release-deploy-calendar`
    - `heroku container:release web -a release-deploy-calendar`

### Other commands  
- `heroku logs --tail -a release-deploy-calendar`  
- `heroku apps`  

## Why is there a backend?
Q: But Jooones, why does this app have a backend? Can't you just write all of it in the frontend so the app is less heavy-weight?  
J: Because we wanted to write some kotlin for the very first time in our lives.  
_..starts sweating.._  
Q: But there's barely any kotlin in there, you didn't even write a real test?  
J: RUN PIETER, EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
